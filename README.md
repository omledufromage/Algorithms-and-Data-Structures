## Algorithms and Data Structures

This repository is meant to help organize my studies in Algorithms and Data Structures. I am using Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest and Stein) and [Projeto de Algoritmos em C](https://www.ime.usp.br/~pf/algoritmos/) (Feofiloff) as study references.
